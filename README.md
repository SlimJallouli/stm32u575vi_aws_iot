# FreeRTOS STM32U575VI STM32CubeMX AWS Reference
## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to integrate modular [ FreeRTOS kernel ](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html) and [ libraries ](https://www.freertos.org/libraries/categories.html). The project is pre-configured to run on the [ STM32U575VI ](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32u575vi.html) which includes an kit which includes an [ STM32U5 ](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32u5-series.html) microcontroller.

The *Project* is a Non-TrustZone project which  demonstrate connecting to AWS IoT Core and utilizing many of the services available via the MQTT protocol.


This includes demonstration tasks for the following AWS services:
* [AWS IoT Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html)
* [AWS IoT Device Defender](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-defender.html)
* [AWS IoT Jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-jobs.html)
* [MQTT File Delivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt-based-file-delivery.html)
* [AWS IoT OTA Update](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/freertos-ota-dev.html)

The demo project connect to AWS IoT core via the included Wi-Fi module and use the [CoreMQTT-Agent](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT-Agent) library to share a single MQTT connection among multiple tasks. These tasks publish data from a PubSub task, and demonstrate use of the AWS IoT Device Shadow and Device Defender services.

This peoject is generated using [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/stm32cubemx). Means it can be easily changed throu STM32CubeMX and it is easier to port it to a different hardware.

## AWS IoT Core Demo Tasks
* MQTT Agent
* IoT Defender
* OTA Update
* Publish and Subscribe

## Key Software Components
### LWIP TCP/IP Stack
See [ lwIP ](https://github.com/lwip-tcpip/lwip) for details.

### Mbedtls 3.1.1 TLS and Cryptography library
See [ MbedTLS ](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/mbedtls-arm/versions/) for details.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
The CLI interface located in the Common/cli directory is used to provision the device. It also provides other Unix-like utilities. See [Common/cli](Common/cli/ReadMe.md) for details.

### Key-Value Store
The key-value store located in the Common/kvstore directory is used to store runtime configuration values in STM32's internal flash memory.
See [Common/kvstore](Common/kvstore/ReadMe.md) for details.

### PkiObject API
The PkiObject API takes care of some of the mundane tasks in converting between different representations of cryptographic objects such as public keys, private keys, and certificates. See [Common/crypto](Common/crypto/ReadMe.md) for details.

### Mbedtls Transport
The *Common/net/mbedtls_transport.c* file contains a transport layer implementation for coreMQTT and coreHTTP which uses mbedtls to encrypt the connection in a way supported by AWS IoT Core.

Optionally, client key / certificate authentication may be used with the mbedtls transport or this parameter may be set to NULL if not needed.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone using HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/SlimJallouli/b_u585_iota02_aws_iot.git --recurse-submodules
```
Using SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:SlimJallouli/b_u585_iota02_aws_iot.git --recurse-submodules
```
If you have downloaded the repo without using the `--recurse-submodules` argument, you should run:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Generate the project using STM32CubeMX

After you make your changes with STM32CubeMX, you need to run the **update.sh** script. You will get build errors if you do not run the **update.sh** script

make  sure to update the **HOME="C:/Users/stred** before you run the **update.sh** script.
